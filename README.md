# BreatheBreak

A lightweight macOS menu bar app that reminds you to take regular breaks from your screen.

## What it does

BreatheBreak sits in your menu bar and sends you a notification every 20 minutes (by default) to step away, stretch, and give your eyes a rest. You can adjust the interval to whatever works for you, and start or stop reminders whenever you want.

## Getting started

Requires **Python 3** and **macOS**.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python break_reminder.py
```

The app appears in your menu bar. Click it to start/stop reminders or change the interval.

## Features

- Runs quietly in the macOS menu bar
- Configurable reminder interval
- Native macOS notifications
- Start and stop with one click

## Why I built this

I kept losing track of time during long coding sessions and my eyes were paying for it. I wanted something dead simple that does one job -- nudge me to step away every once in a while. No bloat, no distractions, just a gentle reminder.
